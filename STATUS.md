# STATUS.md — the honest ledger

Updated every session. Format: what works (with the test that proves it),
what is broken, what is untested, what is next. Never claim success that was
not observed.

## Date: 2026-10-17 (session 1, part 3)

### Working — proven by `make test` (11/11 pass, GUI included)

| Area | Proof |
|------|-------|
| PE32+ loading (map, relocs, imports, TLS, protections) + recursive PE DLL loading | all tests; t08 loads real `libwinpthread-1.dll` |
| ms_abi ABI bridge, TEB/PEB/GS-base, LDR lists | all tests |
| Console I/O + in-tree printf engine (MS-ABI varargs) | t01, t02 |
| args/env/CWD, GetCommandLine | t03 |
| Files (CI-reopen, delete, size, seek) | t04 |
| Directories + FindFirstFile (Windows dot semantics) | t05 |
| Threads + critical sections | t06 |
| Events/semaphores/WFMO/recursive mutex | t07 |
| Static `__thread` TLS + Tls API | t08 |
| Module APIs | t09 |
| VirtualAlloc/Protect/Query/Free + heap | t10 |
| **GUI vertical slice: X11 via dlopen, window, message loop, WM_PAINT, GDI FillRect/TextOut (server-rendered fonts via glyph cache), timers, destroy** | **t11 under Xvfb** |

### GUI architecture (as of this session)

* `src/backends/`: backend abstraction; X11 implemented with **zero X11
  headers** (dlopen + dlsym + wire-ABI overlay structs). Text rendering
  draws glyphs server-side into a scratch pixmap and reads them back with
  XGetImage — real fonts, no font library linked.
* user32: classes, windows, message queue (eventfd wake), timers,
  keysym->VK translation, DefWindowProc.
* gdi32: DCs over software BGRA buffers; window DIB layout == X11 32bpp
  ZPixmap, so present() is zero-conversion.
* Wayland: hand-marshalled wire protocol; display connect + registry +
  sync roundtrip verified; surface path (xdg_shell/shm) in progress —
  init() currently fails honestly and the selector falls back to X11.

### Broken / partial (unchanged from part 2 unless noted)

- SEH table-based unwinding (x64 .pdata/.xwave) still not implemented.
- MessageBox, dialogs, child windows, scrollbars: not implemented (stubs).
- Graphics: only software rendering; Vulkan loader present but no
  D3D/GL translation yet (`make bench` reports what exists).
- musl build not attempted.

### Environment notes

* Xvfb started automatically by the test runner for GUI cases.
* ASan found and we fixed: missing msvcrt export terminator, stub-info
  realloc use-after-free, XImage ABI offsets (my overlay struct had
  wrong member alignment), GetMessage timer starvation (pure pump(-1)),
  double-free in DestroyWindow.

### Next

1. PE-loader fuzzer under ASan (`make fuzz`) — hardening.
2. Wayland surface path (xdg_shell + shm present + seat input).
3. Vulkan: instance, surface via Xlib, swapchain; D3D9->Vulkan translation
   start; `winnux bench` with real numbers.
4. More Win32 surface: ws2_32 sockets, console input, more GDI (fonts,
   dialogs), then real apps (Notepad-class, installers).
